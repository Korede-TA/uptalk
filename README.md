# uptalk
Encrypted messaging service based on Upspin (upspin.io)

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

I figured that the file-sharing/access model that upspin is based on might be optimal for building a minimal encrpyted chat service.

This might not prove to be overwhelmighly useful to anyone but I thought it would be cool to attempt.
